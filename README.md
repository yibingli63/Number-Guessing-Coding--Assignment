Write a program in Java to play a number-guessing game. The game works as follows:
The user chooses a number in his mind and types “ready” to indicate to the computer that he is ready to begin playing.
The computer asks a series of questions to arrive at the number the user has in mind. The user can only respond with “higher”, “lower” or “yes”.
The game ends when the user responds with “yes” or “end”.
